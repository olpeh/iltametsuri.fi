Founded in September 2019 as a part-time business, Iltametsuri Oy has grown significantly beyond its original concept. The company specializes in safe and efficient tree removal, including challenging situations where trees are located near buildings, power lines, or other structures. The company uses various techniques including climbing, crane assistance, and specialized equipment to ensure safe tree removal.
