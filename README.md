Homepage for Iltametsuri Oy

This page serves as a landing page for my side business company as well as an example how you can create a simple landing page as a single HTML file with inline CSS styles.
Such a page can achieve high performance as long as the HTML file size remains small enough.

## Development

Since this repository is a simple HTML page, you can use the following command:

```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

for serving the `index.html` file in port 8000.

## Deployments

The site is automatically deployed to Netlify when pushing to the master branch.
